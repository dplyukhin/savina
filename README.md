Savina
======

[Savina](https://github.com/shamsimam/savina) is an Actor Benchmark Suite, originally developed by Shams Imam at Rice University.

This is a fork of Savina, used to evaluate the UIGC actor GC. Benchmarks related to Akka have been moved to Pekko/UIGC, and all other benchmarks have been removed.
